Overall plan
1) set up standard env
2) test beta reducer on some display test cases
3) make main which reads a term from the repl, prints type
and reduction to normal form


make display a functor?!

keycircl and keycircr are tptally backwards
change source to lang so that display.mli is less confusing?

organize checker.mli like reduce.mli
