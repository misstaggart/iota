Overall plan
3) make main which reads a term from the repl, prints type
and reduction to normal form
4) go through all the code to make sure it's neat and documented,
try and abstract some of your string munging if you can


make display a functor?!

keycircl and keycircr are tptally backwards
change source to lang so that display.mli is less confusing?

organize checker.mli like reduce.mli
